# octahedral-rotations
Python module to compute octahedral rotation and tilt angles in orthorhombic perovskite structures (ABX3)


## Functionality:
    * enumerates B-X bonds
    * computes bond angles projected onto planes orthogonal to the pseudocubic
      lattice vectors
    * computes rotation and tilt angles averaged across all anions

Sample usage in examples/example.py

## TODO list:
    * Allow for cations and anions to be redefined without reinitializing
      OctahedralRotations
    * Implement octahedral rotation pattern recognition
